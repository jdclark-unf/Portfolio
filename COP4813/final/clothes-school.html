We all remember our first day of college- nervously thinking about what to wear, what to carry, how to make friends <br>
and all kinds of questions running through our minds. Here is a small guideline to help you make your first day a bit easier.


<h3>Here are a few acceptable things you CAN wear to class</h3>
<img src="images/clothes2.jpg"height="500" width="500"> <br><br>
<ul>


<li>Blazers</li>
Blazers are chic and professional. They create a composed look while remaining casual. It is essential to have at <br>
least one or two neutral colored blazers in one’s closet. Blazers can dress up jeans or dress down satin shorts.<br>

<li>Flats</li>
Flats are not as casual as flip-flops but not as dressy as heels. Not only are they a cute accessory, they are extremely <br>
comfortable. A pair of black flats can match with almost every outfit. The smacking of sandals and the clacking of heels<br>
does not compare to the quiet pitter-patter of flats.

<li>High-waist skirts</li>
High-waist skirts should rest above your belly button with your shirt tucked underneath. They are more attractive when <br>
they are loose fitting and topped off with a belt. It is important to remember that the shorter the skirt, the more likely<br> 
the wind will enjoy flinging it up.

<li>Button downs</li>
When you do not want to settle for a plain t-shirt, button downs come in handy. They add texture to one’s outfit <br>
and create a professional persona. While they match with almost everything, they go best with skinny jeans.

<li>Skinny jeans</li>
Skinny jeans are one of the essentials everyone should have in their closet. Since they come in every wash imaginable,<br>
 it is not difficult to find something to match them with. They are most flattering when paired with a loose fitting top.<br>
 The best part about skinny jeans is how well they go with almost any shoe. They can be tucked into a boot for a casual <br>
 look or worn with pumps for a night on the town.

<li>Maxi dress/skirt
Maxi dresses are no longer limited to pregnant women and hippies — anyone can wear them. Since they <br>
are so long and loose fitting, everyone looks good in them regardless of their body shape. Maxi dresses are<br>
 ideal for wearing in a professional setting because they are so conservative; no one has anything to gawk at.

<li>Linen Pants</li>
If you are looking for something comfortable as well as stylish, linen pants are what you are looking for. They are loose <br>
and free and keep your outfit simple without looking too casual. Nothing says fabulous more than wrinkle-free linen pants and <br>
a simple tank top
</ul>

<h3>What not to wear to class</h3>
<img src="images/clothes1.jpg"height="500" width="500"> <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Don’t wear high heels</li>
Beauty does have its sacrifices, but it isn’t practical to sport high heels all day around campus. Unless you have <br
>a job interview right after, there’s no reason to trek to math class in six-inch heels. “UNF’s grounds aren’t high-heel friendly, <br>
and a professor wouldn’t take you seriously,” said Arielle Butler, a UNF senior majoring in multimedia journalism.

<li>Don’t wear pajamas</li>
For some odd reason, students wearing pajamas to class has become some unwritten college fashion staple. Many think <br>
it isn’t a faux pas, but donning a pair of nighties to class is just unacceptable. Professors won’t think you’re a <br>
serious student (try asking for a letter of recommendation in your butterfly-print jammies), and classmates will think <br>
you’re lazy and unattractive. So keep the PJs in your room. 
Black yoga pants are a comfy alternative that won’t make <br>
you look like you just rolled out of bed.


<li>Don’t show your goodies</li>
Guys, say no to the sag. Ladies, wearing a thong with low-rise jeans is the ultimate sin. And with chiffon tops all the rage<br> 
this season, make sure you’re covering up your bra–try a camisole underneath. No one you’d want to impress is dying to see <br>
the design of your  underwear. To find the perfect jeans, check out brands like Lucky, Guess, Rock and Republic,<br> True Religion, or 
browse local consignment shops for a great vintage find. Forever 21 sells dirt-cheap camisoles in nearly <br>
every color.Don’t wear socks with your sandals. While sandals and flip-flops can be extremely comfortable, there is <br>
a certain way to wear them. Sure, socks help keep your feet clean and warm, but pairing the two together is a fashion crime. <br>
According to electronic media senior Jerrel Kight, women wearing socks with their flip-flops screams unhygienic. <br>
“That is a major don’t,” Kight said. If your feet get cold in those  air-conditioned classrooms, opt for a pair of TOMS, <br>
which are comfy and stylish and cover your feet.Good luck, look sharp and stay classy, Ospreys.

<li>Swimsuits</li>
A student enters wearing a bikini with a teeny tiny cover-up over it. Their shoulders and arms, most of their stomach, and 85%<br>
of their legs are visible to everyone. As class continues, air conditioning gets the best  of them and goose bumps attack <br>

the surface of their skin.Although their Victoria’s Secret ensemble is adorable, 
 it stops being cute when the male professor and that.<br>
 creepy guy who sits in the back of the room agree  The only beachwear one should wear to class is a tan
 Furry shoes Early <br>
 morning classes always get the best of us but that’s no excuse for showing up in those extremely ridiculous, fuzzy slippers <br>from Hot Topic. 
They should be restricted to your dorm room, particularly when your roommates are out of sight. What<br>
 outfit could you possibly match them with? You may argue, “Well, Snooki wears her slippers in public!” Well, that’s because <br>
 she is Snooki. Your wild slipper shoes may earn you extra attention but it could also keep you forever labeled as “Crazy Slipper Girl.”


<li>Visible bra straps</li>
Bras were created to give women support under their clothes. Flailing straps turn your crop top from cute to trashy. The color<br>
of a woman’s bra should be a mystery.If you want to wear a racer back tank top, put your push-up away and throw on a strapless.<br>
<li>Leggings</li> 
Some consider these to be yoga/workout pants, but their alter ego is known as “butt pants.” Girls loveto wear them and guys<br>
 love to check girls out when they wear them. Yes, they are oh so comfortable, but what kind of message are you sending?<br>
 Being so tight, it gives viewers great insight into what your lower half  is shaped like. One cannot help but stare at your <br>
 butt as it shakes from side to side while you walk.  Do not wear leggings unless it is paired with a shirt that covers your<br> 
 entire booty. Thongs plus low-rise jeans. It’s early, your professor is boring, and you cannot help but lean forward and bury <br>
 your head in your arms. The students sitting behind you cannot help but notice your black lace thong peeking out.shouldn’t<br>
 have worn those.  tight, low-rise jeans.The only thing worse than a visible thong is a visible butt crack. Most victims have no.<br>
 idea what they are sharing with the world until it is too late. Make sure you check all angles in the mirror before leaving <br>
 your dorm because this fashion crime goes hand in hand with embarrassment.
<li>Junderwear</li>
When the weather gets warm, people cannot help but whip out their shorts. Some continue to wear their clothes from last summer,<br>
 ignorant of the fact that they no longer fit.This is how the term “junderwear” was coined. Junderwear are jean shorts that <br>
 are so short they could be considered underwear.If you are wearing shorts where the pockets hang out from underneath, nothing<br>
 fits in your pockets, or your butt is hanging out, you are wearing junderwear. I suggest you remove them immediately and replace<br>
 them with more appropriate bottoms.
